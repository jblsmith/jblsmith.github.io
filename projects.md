### CrossSong puzzle (2015)
CrossSong is a music-based puzzle game in which the goal is to recognize the component parts of mash-ups. The player is faced with a grid of tiles, each representing a mash-up between two songs, and they must rearrange the tiles so that the tiles in each row and each column contain parts of the same song. The project was mostly about making a fun game, but research contributions also include an algorithm for finding an optimal combination of mashups. Project page includes a link to the playable game!

### PhD thesis (2014)
My PhD thesis considered listener disagreements in the analysis of musical structure, and looked at the issue from a number of viewpoints in different disciplines: music information retrieval, music theory and music perception and cognition. It combined elements of all the projects below except the MIREX meta-analysis and SALAMI projects.

### Attention and grouping (2014)
This online listening study investigated how the focus of a listener can affect the perception of structure. We find that by manipulating someone's attention, whether overtly or obliquely, we can influence the salience of boundaries and the structural groupings they prefer. This work is not yet published.

### MIREX meta-analysis (2013)
This ISMIR paper focused on what we could learn from the MIREX Structural Segmentation task after new data about the ground truth were published in 2012. This was my first attempt at producing "open research", meaning that all the tools and data used to produce the article are provided in an open repository.

### Estimating feature relevance (2013)
In this project, we propose a method for determining what musical attributes someone was paying attention to when they produced an annotation of a piece of music. The concept is relatively straightforward, and we get some interesting results using a simple quadratic programming algorithm.

### Boundaries and novelty (2012)
This IEEE Transactions on Multimedia article describes a test of how well acoustic novelty accounts for boundary indications in an annotated corpus.

### Listener disagreements (2012)
Co-authored by Isaac Schankler, this case study investigated how listeners manage to produce structural analyses that disagree with each other. The Music Theory Online article contains lots of audio files, videos and illustrationsâ€”definitely a welcome counterbalance to the dense text!

### Master's thesis (2010)
For my Master's thesis, submitted in August 2010, I conducted a comparative evaluation of a handful of algorithms that produce formal analyses of music on a diverse set of corpora, including a new corpus of public domain music.

### SALAMI (2010)
The Structural Analysis of Large Amounts of Music Information (SALAMI) project is a multi-national effort to produce a corpus of analyses of hundreds of thousands of pieces of music. I oversaw the first phase of this project: the creation of a huge ground truth dataset. As part of my work, I developed and tested a novel annotation format, evaluated and hired annotators, oversaw months of data collection and presented the data at ISMIR 2011. I continue to manage and develop the dataset, which was released to the public in February 2012.
