### [CrossSong puzzle (2015)](https://staff.aist.go.jp/jun.kato/CrossSong/)
<a class="project_icon" href="https://staff.aist.go.jp/jun.kato/CrossSong/"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/thumbnail_crosssong.png" /></a>
CrossSong is a music-based puzzle game in which the goal is to recognize the component parts of mash-ups. The player is faced with a grid of tiles, each representing a mash-up between two songs, and they must rearrange the tiles so that the tiles in each row and each column contain parts of the same song. The project was mostly about making a fun game, but research contributions also include an algorithm for finding an optimal combination of mashups. Project page includes a link to the playable game!

### [PhD thesis (2014)]({{ site.baseurl }}/projects/phd-thesis/)

My PhD thesis considered listener disagreements in the analysis of musical structure, and looked at the issue from a number of viewpoints in different disciplines: music information retrieval, music theory and music perception and cognition. The following four projects comprised the main chapters:

#### [Attention and grouping (2014)]({{ site.baseurl }}/projects/attention-grouping/)
<a class="project_icon" href="{{ site.baseurl }}/projects/attention-grouping/"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/thumbnail_attention.png" /></a>
This online listening study investigated how the focus of a listener can affect the perception of structure. We find that by manipulating someone's attention, whether overtly or obliquely, we can influence the salience of boundaries and the structural groupings they prefer.

#### [Estimating feature relevance (2013)]({{ site.baseurl }}/projects/feature-relevance/)
<a class="project_icon" href="{{ site.baseurl }}/projects/feature_relevance/"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/thumbnail_relevance.png" /></a>
In this project, we propose a method for determining what musical attributes someone was paying attention to when they produced an annotation of a piece of music. The concept is relatively straightforward, and we get some interesting results using a simple quadratic programming algorithm.

#### [Boundaries and novelty (2012)]({{ site.baseurl }}/projects/boundaries-novelty/)
<a class="project_icon" href="{{ site.baseurl }}/projects/boundaries-novelty/"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/thumbnail_boundaries.png" /></a>
How well acoustic novelty accounts for boundary indications in an annotated corpus?
<!-- This *IEEE Transactions on Multimedia* article describes a test of h -->

#### [Listener disagreements (2012)]({{ site.baseurl }}/projects/listener-disagreements/)
<a class="project_icon" href="{{ site.baseurl }}/projects/listener-disagreements/"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/thumbnail_listeners.png" /></a>
Co-authored by Isaac Schankler, this case study investigated how listeners manage to produce structural analyses that disagree with each other. The Music Theory Online article contains lots of audio files, videos and illustrationsâ€”definitely a welcome counterbalance to the dense text!

### [MIREX meta-analysis (2013)]({{ site.baseurl }}/projects/mirex-meta-analysis/)
<a class="project_icon" href="{{ site.baseurl }}/projects/mirex-meta-analysis/"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/thumbnail_mirexmeta.png" /></a>
This ISMIR paper focused on what we could learn from the MIREX Structural Segmentation task after new data about the ground truth were published in 2012. This was my first attempt at producing "open research", meaning that all the tools and data used to produce the article are provided in an open repository.

### [Master's thesis (2010)]({{ site.baseurl }}/projects/masters-thesis/)
<a class="project_icon" href="{{ site.baseurl }}/projects/masters-thesis/"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/thumbnail_masters.png" /></a>
For my Master's thesis, submitted in August 2010, I conducted a comparative evaluation of a handful of algorithms that produce formal analyses of music on a diverse set of corpora, including a new corpus of public domain music.

### [SALAMI (2010)](http://ddmal.music.mcgill.ca/research/salami/)
<a class="project_icon" href="http://ddmal.music.mcgill.ca/research/salami/"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/thumbnail_salami.png" /></a>
The Structural Analysis of Large Amounts of Music Information (SALAMI) project is a multi-national effort to produce a corpus of analyses of hundreds of thousands of pieces of music. I oversaw the first phase of this project: the creation of a huge ground truth dataset. As part of my work, I developed and tested a novel annotation format, evaluated and hired annotators, oversaw months of data collection and presented the data at ISMIR 2011. I continue to manage and develop the dataset, which was released to the public in February 2012. It's [available now on GitHub](https://github.com/DDMAL/salami-data-public).
