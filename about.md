I'm a postdoc studying music technology. I'm currently working with Professor Masataka Goto at AIST in Japan on a diverse set of projects, from music analysis to video classification to game development.

My previous research focused on musical structureâ€”i.e., the abstract form of a piece, or how it is composed of repeated and varied sections. My PhD thesis considered the question of what leads listeners to disagree about structural analyses; it was a multi-disciplinary effort that used tools and techniques of music information retrieval, music theory and music perception and cognition.

Before finishing my Ph.D. at Queen Mary University of London, I completed Master's degrees at USC (in Operations Research) and at McGill University (in Music Technology). At McGill, as part of the SALAMI project, I studied the annotation of musical structure. As a result, I've become deeply interested in what information these annotations actually contain and how we can understand them better.
