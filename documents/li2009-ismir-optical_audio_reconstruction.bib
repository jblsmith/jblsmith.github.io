	Abstract = {Our work focuses on optically reconstructing the stereo audio signal of a 33 rpm long-playing (LP) record using a white-light interferometry-based approach. Previously, a theoretical framework was presented, alongside the primitive reconstruction result from a few cycles of a stereo sinusoidal test signal. To reconstruct an audible duration of a longer stereo signal requires tackling new problems, such as disc warping, image alignment, and eliminating the effects of noise and broken grooves. This paper proposes solutions to these problems, and presents the complete workflow of our Optical Audio Reconstruction (OAR) system.},
