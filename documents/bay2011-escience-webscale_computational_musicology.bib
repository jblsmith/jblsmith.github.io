	Abstract = {We summarise our accomplishments on the Structural Analysis of Large Amount of Music Information (SALAMI) project in which we have developed a state-of-the-art infrastructure for conducting research in music structural analysis. The project was outlined in AHM 2010 with a proof of concept case study, and in the subsequent 12 months we have substantially developed three areas which we outline in the following sections: annotation and the creation of ground truth data, development of a new model of data representation of sequential and hierarchical divisions, and testing the algorithms which will be used to perform the calculations. The ground truth data and the ontology are contributions to the field which have broad applicability beyond this project. In the next phase of the project we will use the algorithms to perform the large-scale analysis.},
