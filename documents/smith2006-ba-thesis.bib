	Abstract = {It has been observed by Manaris et al. (2005) that in a particular performance of a particular Bach cantata, while the statistical distribution of note lengths as defined by the score corresponds to a highly repetitive distribution called 'black noise,' the subtle changes in timing in the performance of the cantata led to a more even distribution of note lengths indicative of 'pink noise.' In order to explore how generalizable this effect was, a more substantial data set was collected, including five solo piano pieces of varied genres played four times each by six skilled performers. The note lengths were analyzed in addition to other metrics. Two main observations were made: first, for any particular piece, the distributions for a given metric remained roughly the same across all performances by all performers; and second, that the distributions of some metrics were substantially changed -- often in strikingly similar ways -- when the performed versions were compared to the scored versions. Contrary to the expectations set up by Manaris et al. that the distributions would seek out more regular, 'Zipfian' properties in performance, it appears that the changes mostly led only to an increase in statistical randomness.},
