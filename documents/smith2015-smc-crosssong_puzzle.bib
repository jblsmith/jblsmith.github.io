	Abstract = {There is considerable interest in music-based games, as the popularity of Rock Band and others can attest, as well as puzzle games. However, these have rarely been combined. Most music-based games fall into the category of rhythm games, and in those games where music is incorporated into a puzzle-like challenge, music usually serves as either an accompaniment or reward. We set out to design a puzzle game where musical knowledge and analysis would be essential to making deductions and solving the puzzle.

The result is the CrossSong Puzzle, a novel type of music-based logic puzzle that truly integrates musical and logical reasoning. The game presents a player with a grid of tiles, each representing a mashup of measures from two different songs. The goal is to rearrange the tiles so that each row and column plays a continuous musical excerpt.

Automatically identifying a set of song fragments to fill a grid such that each tile contains an acceptable mash-up is our primary technical hurdle. We propose an algorithm that analyses a corpus of music, searches the space of possible fragments, and selects an arrangement that maximizes the ``mashability'' of the resulting grid. This algorithm and the interaction design of the system are the main contributions.},
