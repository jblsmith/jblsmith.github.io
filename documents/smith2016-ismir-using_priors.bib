	Abstract = {Existing collections of annotations of musical structure possess many strong regularities: for example, the lengths of segments are approximately log-normally distributed, as is the number of segments per annotation; and the lengths of two adjacent segments are highly likely to have an integer ratio. Since many aspects of structural annotations are highly regular, but few of these regularities are taken into account by current algorithms, we propose several methods of improving predictions of musical structure by using their likelihood according to prior distributions. We test the use of priors to improve a committee of basic segmentation algorithms, and to improve a committee of cutting-edge approaches submitted to MIREX. In both cases, we are unable to improve on the best committee member, meaning that our proposed approach is outperformed by simple parameter tuning. The same negative result was found despite incorporating the priors in multiple ways. To explain the result, we show that although there is a correlation overall between output accuracy and prior likelihood, the weakness of the correlation in the high-likelihood region makes the proposed method infeasible. We suggest that to improve on the state of the art using prior likelihoods, these ought to be incorporated at a deeper level of the algorithm.},
