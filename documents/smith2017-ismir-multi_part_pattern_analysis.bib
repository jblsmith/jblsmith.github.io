	Abstract = {Structure is usually estimated as a single-level phenomenon with full-texture repeats and homogeneous sections. However, structure is actually multi-dimensional: in a typical piece of music, individual instrument parts can repeat themselves in independent ways, and sections can be homogeneous with respect to several parts or only one part. We propose a novel MIR task, multi-part pattern analysis, that requires the discovery of repeated patterns within instrument parts. To discover repeated patterns in individual voices, we propose an algorithm that applies source separation and then tailors the structure analysis to each estimated source, using a novel technique to resolve transitivity errors. Creating ground truth for this task by hand would be infeasible for a large corpus, so we generate a synthetic corpus from MIDI files. We synthesize audio and produce measure-by-measure descriptions of which instruments are active and which repeat themselves exactly. Lastly, we present a set of appropriate evaluation metrics, and use them to compare our approach to a set of baselines.},
