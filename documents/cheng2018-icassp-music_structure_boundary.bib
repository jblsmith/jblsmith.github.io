	Abstract = {We propose a music structure analysis method that converts a path-enhanced self-similarity matrix (SSM) into a block-enhanced SSM using non-negative matrix factor 2-D deconvolution (NMF2D). With a non-negative constraint, the deconvolution intuitively corresponds to the repeated stripes in the path-enhanced SSM. Then the block-enhanced SSM is constructed without any clustering technique. We fuse block-enhanced SSMs obtained using different parameters, resulting in better and more robust results. Discussion shows that the proposed method can be a potential tool for analysing music structure at different scales.},
