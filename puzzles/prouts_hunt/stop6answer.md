All of the ingredients can be combined to form [Ben & Jerry's ice cream flavours](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Ben_and_jerry%27s_ice_creams). If you identify the ingredients and alphabetize them, you will get the appropriate numbering. The ingredients are:

1. Almonds
2. Banana
3. Butter
4. Caramel
5. Cherry
6. Chocolate (or Chocolate Chips)
7. Coffee
8. Heath Bar
9. Graham Crackers
10. Marshmallow
11. Mint
12. Oreo
13. Pecans
14. Potato Chips
15. Turtle
16. Vanilla
17. Walnuts
18. White Chocolate

Which makes the flavours as follows:


	CHERRY GARCIA
	LATE NIGHT SNACK
	NEW YORK SUPER FUDGE CHUNK
	COFFEE HEATH BAR CRUNCH
	VANILLA HEATH BAR CRUNCH
	SMORES
	PHISH FOOD
	MINT CHOCOLATE COOKIE
	TURTLE SOUP
	CHUNKY MONKEY
	BUTTER PECAN
	MINT CHOCOLATE CHUNK

The circled letters, in bold above, spell the answer: <code>RAINFOREST CRUNCH</code>, a beloved retired Ben and Jerry's flavour.

The puzzle owes a debt of influence to the lovely puzzle [Incredible Edibles](http://www.mit.edu/~puzzle/12/charles_lutwidge_dodgson/incredible_edibles/) by Emily Morgan et al.! Although when I ran this hunt, players received the physical ingredients instead of images, which was much tastier.
