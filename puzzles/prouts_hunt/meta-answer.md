By this stage, you'll have obtained the following 10 puzzle answers:

	AUSTIN POWERS
	BUCKET ALGORITHM
	COMMUNICATED
	COTTAGE INDUSTRY
	DIEGO LUNA
	EXHAUSTION
	FLIPMODE SQUAD
	GUITAR HERO
	RAINFOREST CRUNCH
	VECTOR QUANTITY

The 10 answers each have all 5 vowels (and sometimes Y... treat these as consonants). If you ignore the consonants, you can arrange the 5-vowel strings into the 5x5 grid provided to make a [Latin square](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_square): i.e., each vowel appears once in every row or column. This arrangement ignores the consonants that appear between vowels; the consonants that appear on the "outsides" of the words (like the <code>FL</code> and the <code>D</code> in <code>FLIPMODE SQUAD</code>) have room to project beyond the central square. Determining the only possible placement of all the words, you'll get the following:

            DCVG
          *-----*
         R|AIOEU|NCH
         B|UEAOI|THM
        FL|IOEUA|D
         C|OUIAE|D
          |EAUIO|N
          *-----*
           R ST
           S TY
             R
             Y

Taking the letters that appear in squares 1 to 13 in order produces the string <code>MCDNLDSDRVTHR</code>. Naturally, the message is missing its vowels. You must insert them to produce the final answer to the hunt: <code>MCDONALD'S DRIVE THRU</code>!

### Congratulations!
