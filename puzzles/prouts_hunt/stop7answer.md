Each of the songs on the mix CD is an automatic reconstruction of one song using audio samples from another song by the same artist. This was done using the [A from B](http://code.google.com/p/echo-nest-remix/source/browse/trunk/examples/afromb/afromb.py) function of the [Echo Nest Remix SDK](http://code.google.com/p/echo-nest-remix/). The best songs to listen to to really hear this effect are the Outkast and U2 examples, since the rhythms of the reconstructed songs are distinctive. The song pairs are:

**Artist**		| **Song being reconstructed**	| **Source song**
Feist			| I Feel It All					| 1, 2, 3, 4
Lady Gage		| Born This Way					| Edge of Glory
Interpol		| Narc							| Public Pervert
Phoenix			| Lisztomania					| 1901
Michael Jackson	| I Want You Back				| Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough
Outkast			| Hey Ya 						| B.O.B. (Bombs Over Baghdad)
David Bowie		| Rebel Rebel					| Suffragette City
Eminem			| [I don't remember!] 			| [I don't remember!]
Sufjan Stevens	| The Upper Peninsula			| John Wayne Gacy, Jr.
Queen			| Another One Bites the Dust 	| Bohemian Rhapsody
U2				| Sunday Bloody Sunday			| Beautiful Day
Adele			| Turning Tables				| Someone Like You
Daft Punk		| Around The World 				| One More Time

Although it's very hard to determine what the song names are, the artists are fairly recognizable. The first letters of the artist names, in the given order, spells the answer: <code>FLIPMODE SQUAD</code>.
