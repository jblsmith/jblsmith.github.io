<h1>Stop 10: Meta puzzle</h1>

What a day! The cousins sure packed in a lot: classic games, meals, traditions, and memorable moments. With all their favourite Prouts memories vividly in mind, the Smiths set about trying to come up with a new tradition. A tradition, perhaps, that can transcend geography; a ritual that can be performed literally everywhere in the world; a custom welcome in any country.

Specifically, perhaps this tradition can be devised by somehow combining their answers with this new puzzle grid.
