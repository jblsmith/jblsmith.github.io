Each set of aliases matches a single other word, which starts a two-word phrase with each alias. For example, the first suspect's name is "<code>JACK</code>" since "<code>JACK FROST</code>", "<code>JACKHAMMER</code>" and "<code>JACKKNIFE</code>" are all words or phrases. Then, each suspect's first name forms a word or two-word phrase when appended to the word "<code>RED</code>" or "<code>BLACK</code>". Since Mafia loyalties are defined by cards of these colours, this tells you whether the person is mafia or not.
	
Note: red/black as an indicator of townsfolk/mafia seems to be extremely typical, although it is not specified on the Wikipedia page for Mafia so I don't presume it is universal. That's why I linked to another page that mentioned the card colours.

The suspects' identities are thus:

- Suspect 1 goes by: <code>BLACK JACK</code>
- Suspect 2 goes by: <code>RED HOT</code>
- Suspect 3 goes by: <code>RED CROSS</code>
- Suspect 4 goes by: <code>BLACK MAIL</code>
- Suspect 5 goes by: <code>BLACK DEATH</code>
- Suspect 6 goes by: <code>RED CARD</code>
- Suspect 7 goes by: <code>BLACK DIAMOND</code>
- Suspect 8 goes by: <code>BLACK MAGIC</code>
- Suspect 9 goes by: <code>BLACK OUT</code>
- Suspect 10 goes by: <code>BLACK BOARD</code>
- Suspect 11 goes by: <code>RED NECK</code>
- Suspect 12 goes by: <code>BLACK BALL</code>

The mafia members' letter strips, when sorted in alphabetical order by suspects' last names (<code>CARD, CROSS, HOT, NECK</code>) gives the answer messages: "<code>GOD, PICK, PLAYER, SOLO, or TAB. QUEST, SANDWICH, or WORSHIP.</code>" Using the same mechanism, this clues the final answer: <code>GUITAR HERO</code>.
