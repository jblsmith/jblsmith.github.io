In this game of [Mafia](http://toast.topped-with-meat.com/connector/mafia.html), you play as Detective Bean, the neutral party sent in to resolve the toughest cases. Says Sheriff Fox:

> Thanks for coming, detective Bean. It's always good to have a neutral party to resolve these mafia cases.
>
> We've had it real bad in our townâ€”lots of mafia folks running around with fake last names. Mostly done a good job of rounding them up, but we just can't sort out these last suspects. We were hoping you could. All we have is a list of everyone's known aliases.
>
> Once you've sorted out who's who, we're looking for information on the mafia we don't yet know about. A secret clue is spelled out on the little message strips carried by the innocent townsfolk. (Of course, the mafia took the step of carrying decoy messages.)
