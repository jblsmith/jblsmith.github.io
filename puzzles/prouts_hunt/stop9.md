Uh oh! It sounds like the cousins are suffering from a bout of transient global amnesia. Help them reorient themselves by following the directions in the alphabetical order of the pictures.

Participants received two collections of unsorted images (they were cut into separate squares and jumbled together) as well as a map (with the starting square indicated as the top left square):
