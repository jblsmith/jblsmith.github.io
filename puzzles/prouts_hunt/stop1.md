No flavour here; this first puzzle was more of a fun warm-up than anything. The participants were given a hat with a bunch of [charades](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charades) and told to act them out. The charades were, in no particular order:

- AMERICAN BEAUTY (1999)
- CONTACT (1997)
- CINDERELLA (1950)
- THE DARK KNIGHT (2008)
- ELF (2003)
- INDEPENDENCE DAY (1996)
- ON THE WATERFRONT (1954)
- MAD MAX (1979)
- THE MUPPET MOVIE (1979)
- NIGHTMARE BEFORE CHRISTMAS (1993)
- TRAINING DAY (2001)
- UHF (1989)

All the charades were films, and the year of each film's release was given on the slip of paper.
