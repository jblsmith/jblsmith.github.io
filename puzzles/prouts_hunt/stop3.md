All the Smiths head to the beach for a game of soccer, only the findâ€”no ball! They'll have to build a new one.

The word puzzle works as follows: the answer to each clue is a 4-letter word. Note that adjoining each hexagon are 3 pentagons. A 4-letter word is to placed in its home hexagon and the 3 adjoining pentagons in any order, not necessarily starting in the home hexagon. As an aid to solving, no two hexagons contain the same letter.

When you're finished, you can cut out the pattern and assemble using tape into a soccer ball!
