If you place the films in order by date, you get:

	CINDERELLA (1950)
	ON THE WATERFRONT (1954)
	(THE) MUPPET MOVIE (1979)
	MAD MAX (1979)
	UHF (1989)
	NIGHTMARE BEFORE CHRISTMAS (1993)
	INDEPENDENCE DAY (1996)
	CONTACT (1997)
	AMERICAN BEAUTY (1999)
	TRAINING DAY (2001)
	ELF (2003)
	(THE) DARK KNIGHT (2008)

Ignoring the initial word "The" where it appears, the first letter of each title in the sorted list gives the answer: <code>COMMUNICATED</code>.
