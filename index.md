I conduct research in the field of music informatics, an interdisciplinary mix of music theory, signal processing and psychology.
My research often focuses on musical structure: i.e., the abstract form of a piece, or how it is composed of repeated and varied sections.

For most of 2018 I was a post-doctoral researcher on a project called "[Dig That Lick](http://dig-that-lick.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/)", which aims to analyze melodic patterns in jazz music on a large scale. It's the second [Digging Into Data](https://diggingintodata.org/)-funded project I've worked on after [SALAMI](http://ddmal.music.mcgill.ca/research/salami).

The work was done jointly at [IRCAM](https://www.ircam.fr/) with [Geoffroy Peeters](http://recherche.ircam.fr/anasyn/peeters/) and at L2S, the [Laboratoire des Signaux et Systèmes](http://www.l2s.centralesupelec.fr/), with Hélène Papadopoulos.

Before this, I spent three years working in Professor Masataka Goto's [Media Interaction Group](https://staff.aist.go.jp/m.goto/MIG/index-j.html) at [AIST](http://www.aist.go.jp/index_en.html) in Japan on a diverse set of projects, from music analysis to video classification to music games.

I [post pictures to Tumblr](http://jblsmith.tumblr.com/) and post more work-related items to a [blog on this site]({{ site.baseurl }}/blog/). In my spare time, I like to participate in puzzle hunts and sometimes help make them. You can check a few of my puzzles out [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/puzzles/).
