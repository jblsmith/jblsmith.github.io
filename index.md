title: What I do
---

Hi! I'm Jordan and I'm a lecturer and research at [Queen Mary University of London](https://www.qmul.ac.uk/) specialising in Computer Science and Music.

I teach within Queen Mary School Hainan, which means I make four 2-week trips to China per year to give lectures. In Fall 2024, I developed and delivered a new module on *Introduction to Digital Audio*; in Spring 2025, I am updating and delivering a module on *Introduction to Data Science Programming*.

I like to build tools or interfaces for playing with music---like [Unmixer](https://unmixer.ongaaccel.jp/), a website for extracting and remixing loops; or the [CrossSong](https://staff.aist.go.jp/jun.kato/CrossSong/) puzzle, a logic puzzle that requires careful listening to solve.

I also like trying to make it possible for computers to solve problems of music analysis or music theory---e.g., [analysing the internal structure]({{ site.baseurl }}/projects/multi-part-pattern-analysis) of a piece of music, or [deciding whether one song]({{ site.baseurl }}/projects/music-video-classification) is a cover, remix, or live rendition of another.

## Previous work

I worked for [TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/) for 4 years, on a team devoted to building algorithms and interfaces for music creation. Before that, I was a post-doctoral researcher for 3 years at [AIST Japan](https://staff.aist.go.jp/m.goto/MIG/index-j.html) in Tsukuba and for one year at [IRCAM](https://www.ircam.fr/) in Paris.

## Research interests

Music structure! I find the way that listeners form an understanding of the internal structure of a piece of music to be fascinating, and I've been trying to understand it better from the start of my academic career. Some find this problem very abstract, but I think this is a sign of its deep connection to other topics, like pattern recognition and the perception of Gestalts.

I am also interested in:

- Music decomposition (e.g., into source loops)
- Tools for music composition (I refuse to call such tools "AI" â€” whatever steps they automate, they should be regarded as tools!)
- Music interfaces
- Experiment design
