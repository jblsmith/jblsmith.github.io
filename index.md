## About me

<p style="font-size: larger; text-align: center;">Hi! I'm Jordan and I'm a researcher in music information retrieval.</p>

Some days, I'm a coder trying to build tools or interfaces for playing with music---like the [Unmixer](https://unmixer.ongaaccel.jp/), a website for extracting and remixing loops; or the [CrossSong](https://staff.aist.go.jp/jun.kato/CrossSong/) puzzle, a logic puzzle that requires careful listening to solve.


Other times, I try to make it possible for computers to solve problems of music analysis or music theory---say, for [analysing the internal structure]({{ site.baseurl }}/projects/multi-part-pattern-analysis) of a piece of music, or [deciding whether one song]({{ site.baseurl }}/projects/music-video-classification) is a cover, remix, or live rendition of another.

<!-- In the [Projects tab]({{ site.baseurl }}/projects/), you'll find a general audience explanation of all my work---or at least, a short explanation! For detailed explanations, head to the [Publications tab]({{ site.baseurl }}/publications/) (or, for certain projects, [my GitHub page](http://www.github.com/jblsmith)). -->

## Where I work

I joined [TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/) in January 2020 as a Research Scientist!

Previously, I was a post-doctoral researcher scientist for 3 years at [AIST Japan](https://staff.aist.go.jp/m.goto/MIG/index-j.html), and Ive had shorter post-docs at [IRCAM](https://www.ircam.fr/) in Paris and [Queen Mary University of London](https://www.qmul.ac.uk/).

## Research interests

Music structure! I've been obsessed with understanding the internal structure of pieces of music from the start of my academic career.

I'm also interested in:

- Loop-based music and source separation
- Perception of musical structure
