I conduct research in the field of music informatics, an interdisciplinary mix of music theory, signal processing and psychology.

I'm currently a post doctoral research scientist working in Professor Masataka Goto's [Media Interaction Group](https://staff.aist.go.jp/m.goto/MIG/index-j.html) at [AIST](http://www.aist.go.jp/index_en.html) in Japan on a diverse set of projects, from music analysis to video classification to music games.

My research often focuses on musical structure: i.e., the abstract form of a piece, or how it is composed of repeated and varied sections. My [PhD thesis]({{ site.baseurl }}/projects/phd-thesis/) considered the question of what leads listeners to disagree about structural analyses. It was a multi-disciplinary effort that used tools and techniques of music information retrieval, music theory and music perception and cognition.

I [post pictures to Tumblr](http://jblsmith.tumblr.com/) and post more work-related items to a [blog on this site]({{ site.baseurl }}/blog/). In my spare time, I like to participate in puzzle hunts and sometimes help make them. You can check a few of my puzzles out [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/puzzles/).


<!-- Before finishing my Ph.D. at Queen Mary University of London, I completed Master's degrees at USC (in Operations Research) and at McGill University (in Music Technology). At McGill, as part of the [SALAMI project](http://ddmal.music.mcgill.ca/research/salami/), I studied the annotation of musical structure. As a result, I've become deeply interested in what information these annotations actually contain and how we can understand them better. -->
