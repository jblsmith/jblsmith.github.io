  <h1>Puzzles</h1>

  <div class="entry">
    <p>I enjoy puzzles of all kinds, especially cryptic crosswords. I participate regularly in puzzle hunts: these are puzzle-solving contests in which groups race to complete a variety of puzzles, which are usually bereft of instructions, or which require solvers to make intuitive leaps in judgement. Beginning in 2012, I have helped to run several of them.</p>

<dl>
  <dt><a href="http://bit.ly/girls-and-boys-game">GABCOP (2014)</a></dt>
  <dd>I helped write and run “Girls and Boys Come Out To Play”, a London-based puzzle hunt that included lots of physical challenges and prop-based puzzles. Lots of fun.</dd>
  <dt><a href="http://www.playdash.org/DASH5/">DASH 5 (2013)</a> and <a href="http://playdash.org/DASH6/">DASH 6 (2014)</a></dt>
  <dd>I led Game Control for DASH 5 and 6 in London. These were the first international editions of the <a href="http://www.playdash.org">Different Area, Same Hunt</a> series of puzzle hunts. These were my first experiences leading game control for a hunt (i.e., scouting locations, recruiting and managing volunteers, producing puzzle kits, etc.).</dd>
  <dt><a href="http://jblsmith.wordpress.com/">Cryptic crossword blog (2013)</a></dt>
  <dd>In autumn 2013 I maintained a blog to which I posted mini-puzzles biweekly (not fortnightly). In an effort to stretch myself, I wrote two sets of clues for each grid.</dd>
  <dt><a href="http://www.music.mcgill.ca/~jordan/prouts_neck_hunt/">Prouts Neck Puzzle Hunt (2012)</a></dt>
  <dd>In June 2012 I made a one-round puzzle hunt for my family to enjoy at the cottage we used to frequent. I spent the equivalent of one work week of my vacation to put it all together, including all the related errands I found myself doing (printing, buying a jigsaw puzzle, groceries, etc.) in the days before the hunt. The hunt was inspired, both in length and in style, by the <a href="http://www.playdash.org">DASH puzzle events</a> that I had played for the previous 2 years. This is a slightly revised version of the hunt with solutions.</dd>
  <dt><a href="http://web.mit.edu/puzzle/www/2012/">MIT Mystery Hunt (2012)</a></dt>
  <dd>As part of team CODEX, I had the honour of helping to write some puzzles for the <a href="http://web.mit.edu/puzzle/www/2012/">2012 MIT Mystery Hunt</a> I contributed <a href="http://web.mit.edu/puzzle/www/2012/puzzles/memos_from_the_management/credits/author_6.html">3 puzzles</a> (and had a helping hand in putting together 3 more). The puzzle I’m most proud of is <a href="http://www.mit.edu/~puzzle/2012/puzzles/okla_holmes_a/yo_dawg_i_herd_you_like_puzzle_hunts/">Yo Dawg, I Herd You Like Puzzle Hunts</a>
—don’t peek at the answer without trying it first!</dd>
  <dt><a href="http://www.hcs.harvard.edu/hunt/2006/hunt/index.html">Harvard Puzzle Hunt (2006)</a></dt>
  <dd>This event was my introduction to puzzle hunts. I helped write the meta puzzle with Emily Morgan and Andrew Lin (who went on to lead the production of CODEX’s Mystery Hunt) and contributed a <a href="http://www.hcs.harvard.edu/hunt/2006/hunt/ingr_9/index.html">couple</a> <a href="http://www.hcs.harvard.edu/hunt/2006/hunt/table_talk/index.html">puzzles</a> too.</dd>
  <dt>The Harvard Independent (2006)</dt>
  <dd>At Harvard, while suffering from senioritis, I also occasionally contributed a puzzle feature to the <a href="http://www.harvardindependent.com/">Harvard Independent</a>. The Indy’s online archive does not reach 2006, so you can’t find these online. But that’s for the best; they included some pretty awful puns and plenty of crosswordese.</dd>
