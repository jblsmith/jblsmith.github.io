I enjoy puzzles of all kinds, especially cryptic crosswords. I participate regularly in puzzle hunts, in which groups race to complete a variety of puzzles that are usually bereft of instructions, or which require solvers to make intuitive leaps in judgement. I have helped to run a few of them, too.

[Harper's Puzzle (2022)](https://harpers.org/archive/2022/10/gentlemens-agreement/)
:	I wrote a puzzle for my wedding, shared it with the setter of *Harper's Magazine*'s cryptic, and it was published in the October 2022 issue. It's a long story; [this blog post]({{ site.baseurl }}/Harpers-cryptic) explains part of it; [this site](https://pig-and-bunny.github.io/proposal/) explains the prelude!

[GABCOP (2014)](http://bit.ly/girls-and-boys-game)
:	I helped write and run "Girls and Boys Come Out To Play", a London-based puzzle hunt that included lots of physical challenges and prop-based puzzles. There is no online record of the hunt except for the introductory puzzles, seen [here](http://bit.ly/girls-and-boys-game) and [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/puzzles/wee-willie-winkie.pdf).

[DASH 5 (2013)](http://www.playdash.org/DASH5/) and [DASH 6 (2014)](http://playdash.org/DASH6/)
:	I led Game Control for DASH 5 and 6 in London. These were the first international editions of the [Different Area, Same Hunt](http://www.playdash.org) series of puzzle hunts. These were my first experiences leading game control for a hunt (i.e., scouting locations, recruiting and managing volunteers, producing puzzle kits, etc.).

[Cryptic crossword blog (2013)](http://jblsmith.wordpress.com/)
:	In autumn 2013 I maintained a blog to which I posted mini-puzzles biweekly (not fortnightly). The purpose was to practice; to this end, I wrote two unrelated sets of clues for each grid.

[Prouts Neck Puzzle Hunt (2012)]({{ site.baseurl }}/puzzles/prouts_hunt/main)
:	In June 2012 I made a one-round puzzle hunt for my family to enjoy at the cottage we used to frequent. I spent the equivalent of one work week of my vacation to put it all together, including all the related errands I found myself doing (printing pages, buying and modifying a jigsaw puzzle, getting groceries for a physical food puzzle, etc.) in the days before the hunt. The hunt was inspired, both in length and in style, by the [DASH puzzle events](http://www.playdash.org) that I had played for the previous 2 years. This is a slightly revised version of the hunt with solutions.

[MIT Mystery Hunt (2012)](http://web.mit.edu/puzzle/www/2012/)
:	As part of team CODEX, I had the honour of helping to write some puzzles for the [2012 MIT Mystery Hunt](http://web.mit.edu/puzzle/www/2012/) I contributed [3 puzzles](http://web.mit.edu/puzzle/www/2012/puzzles/memos_from_the_management/credits/author_6.html) (and had a helping hand in 3 more). The puzzle I'm most proud of is [Yo Dawg, I Herd You Like Puzzle Hunts](http://www.mit.edu/~puzzle/2012/puzzles/okla_holmes_a/yo_dawg_i_herd_you_like_puzzle_hunts/)
---don't peek at the answer without trying it first!

[Harvard Puzzle Hunt (2006)](http://www.hcs.harvard.edu/hunt/2006/hunt/index.html)
:	This event was my introduction to puzzle hunts. I helped write the meta puzzle with Emily Morgan and Andrew Lin (who went on to lead the production of CODEX's Mystery Hunt) and contributed a [couple](http://www.hcs.harvard.edu/hunt/2006/hunt/ingr_9/index.html) [puzzles](http://www.hcs.harvard.edu/hunt/2006/hunt/table_talk/index.html) too.

The Harvard Independent (2006)
:	At Harvard, while suffering from senioritis, I also occasionally contributed a puzzle feature to the [Harvard Independent](http://www.harvardindependent.com/). The Indy's online archive does not reach 2006, so you can't find these online. But that's for the best; they included some pretty awful puns and plenty of crosswordese.
