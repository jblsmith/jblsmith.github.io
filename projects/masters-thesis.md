## A comparison and evaluation of approaches to the automatic formal analysis of musical audio

- [Full text PDF]({{ site.baseurl }}/documents/smith2010-masters_thesis.pdf), [BIB]({{ site.baseurl }}/documents/smith2010-masters_thesis.bib)
- Presented as a poster to the joint AMS/SMT 2010 Annual Meeting. [Poster PDF]({{ site.baseurl }}/documents/smith2010-smt-comparison_and_evaluation-poster.pdf).

I conducted a comparative evaluation of a handful of algorithms that produce formal analyses of music on a diverse set of corpora, including a new corpus of public domain music. In the same spirit, all of the evaluation data (including the full output of each algorithm) can be downloaded from this website. This website hosts the data that is distributed as a supplement to the thesis.

Here's what you can find here:

- The abstract, in English and in French.
- Audio data: a list of the corpora used in the evaluation and links to shareable data.
- Evaluation data: an archive of the output of each algorithm tested in the evaluation.
- Bibliography: a list of papers and articles related to automatic structure analysis, nearly complete up to January 2010. Will always need updating.
- Full text PDF of the submitted and approved thesis.
