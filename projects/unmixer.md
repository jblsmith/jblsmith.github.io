Remix artists want to be able to access the loops and isolated sounds that were used to create a song, but might only have access to the mixed audio. The Unmixer gives them a way to access the "ingredients" of a song and experiment with mashup ideas, all in one place!

To be presented at [ISMIR 2019](https://ismir2019.ewi.tudelft.nl/). Full description to come.
