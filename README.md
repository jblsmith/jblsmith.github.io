# Homepage for Jordan B. L. Smith

This repository hosts my academic homepage. The website can be [viewed here](http://jblsmith.github.io/).

The website is built using [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll). I used [this nifty theme by Barry Clark](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) to get started.
