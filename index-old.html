		<h4>General:</h4>
		<p>I participate in a research field sometimes called Machine Listening. Researchers in this field try to understand (and usually develop programs to predict) how listeners process all kinds of music information, including everything from low level parsing of audio streams (how notes and sounds are perceived by the ear, say) to high level abstractions (such as modelling a listener's musical preferences).</p><br />
        <h4>Narrower:</h4>
        <p>My research focuses on the structure of pieces of music, meaning the large-scale organization of a piece into separate sections and labels to group similar sections together. For example, in much rock music, pieces are divided into <em>verse</em>, <em>chorus</em> and other sections; in classical music, you've probably seen pieces or sections of pieces described as having some form like AABA'.</p><br />
        <h4>Specific:</h4>
        <p>Interestingly, listeners will often interpret different grouping structures from the same piece of music. Why does this happen? Is it because the listeners pay attention to different aspects of the music? If so, are there some kinds of musical situations that are more likely to cause disagreements among listeners than others? These are the questions I'm thinking about while I write my dissertation, which will try to explain how factors beyond the properties of the recording, including a listener's background or what they happen to pay attention to, affect their analysis of a piece of music.</p>

        <p> --><!-- In the past I've studied how music theorists and computer scientists have sought to algorithmically produce descriptions of a piece of music's structure. However, such studies rely on having "ground truth" (descriptions of what the "true structure" of a piece is) to perform evaluations. I had to think about ground truth a lot for the <a href="http://ddmal.music.mcgill.ca/salami/">SALAMI</a> project, and after that I kept wondering how listeners make the decisions they do about what the structure of a given piece is. Now I use familiar ground truth collections for the opposite of their intended purpose: instead of using it to evaluate an analysis system, I am attempting to discover what the ground truth can tell us about how humans analyze music.--><!-- Interestingly, listeners will often interpret different grouping structures from the same piece of music.

		<!-- <p>I'm from Montréal. I started going to school when I was 6 years old. I became addicted and haven't been able to quit since.</p> -->
		<!-- <p>At Harvard I did a joint degree in Music and Physics, and although these interests mostly remained separate, I wound up loving the more mathematical, quantitative research on music I did for my thesis. At McGill, I followed the lead to Prof. Ichiro Fujinaga's lab and the new world of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_information_retrieval">Music Information Retrieval</a>. I completed a Master's there and helped develop a big database of structural annotations called, ingeniously, <a href="http://ddmal.music.mcgill.ca/salami/">SALAMI</a>.</p> -->
		<!-- <p>I started a PhD at University of Southern California with Prof. Elaine Chew in Fall 2010, but she started a new post at Queen Mary University of London the following year. After passing my screening exam in Fall 2011, I left early with a Master's and rejoined Prof. Chew at Queen Mary to restart my PhD, which was completed in October 2014. My dissertation focused on the fact that listeners often disagree about the structure of a piece of music, which poses a problem for those trying to codify structure, or trying to algorithmically predict structure in a purely content-based way. Using a combination of data mining and listening studies, I investigated the cues that listeners use to interpret the large-scale structure of pieces of music, and the way the attention of a listener can influence what they perceive.</p> -->
		<p>I'm a postdoc studying music technology. I'm currently working with Professor Masataka Goto at AIST in Japan on a diverse set of projects, from music analysis to video classification to game development.</p>
		<p>My previous research focused on musical structure—i.e., the abstract form of a piece, or how it is composed of repeated and varied sections. My PhD thesis considered the question of what leads listeners to disagree about structural analyses; it was a multi-disciplinary effort that used tools and techniques of music information retrieval, music theory and music perception and cognition.</p>
		<p>Before finishing my Ph.D. at Queen Mary University of London, I completed Master's degrees at USC (in Operations Research) and at McGill University (in Music Technology). At McGill, as part of the SALAMI project, I studied the annotation of musical structure. As a result, I've become deeply interested in what information these annotations actually contain and how we can understand them better.</p>

			<dt><a href="https://staff.aist.go.jp/jun.kato/CrossSong/">CrossSong puzzle<br />(2015)</a></dt>
			<dd>CrossSong is a music-based puzzle game in which the goal is to recognize the component parts of mash-ups. The player is faced with a grid of tiles, each representing a mash-up between two songs, and they must rearrange the tiles so that the tiles in each row and each column contain parts of the same song. The project was mostly about making a fun game, but research contributions also include an algorithm for finding an optimal combination of mashups. Project page includes a link to the playable game!</dd>
			
			<dt><a href="http://www.music.mcgill.ca/~jordan/phd-thesis/index.shtml">PhD thesis<br />(2014)</a></dt>
			<dd>My PhD thesis considered listener disagreements in the analysis of musical structure, and looked at the issue from a number of viewpoints in different disciplines: music information retrieval, music theory and music perception and cognition. It combined elements of all the projects below except the MIREX meta-analysis and SALAMI projects.</dd>
			
			<dt><a href="http://www.music.mcgill.ca/~jordan/attention-grouping/index.shtml">Attention and grouping<br />(2014)</a></dt>
			<dd>This online listening study investigated how the focus of a listener can affect the perception of structure. We find that by manipulating someone's attention, whether overtly or obliquely, we can influence the salience of boundaries and the structural groupings they prefer. <em>This work is not yet published.</em></dd>
			
			<dt><a href="http://www.music.mcgill.ca/~jordan/mirex-meta-analysis/index.shtml">MIREX meta-analysis<br />(2013)</a></dt>
			<dd>This <em>ISMIR</em> paper focused on what we could learn from the MIREX Structural Segmentation task after new data about the ground truth were published in 2012. This was my first attempt at producing "open research", meaning that all the tools and data used to produce the article are provided in an open repository.</dd>
			
			<dt><a href="http://www.music.mcgill.ca/~jordan/feature-relevance/index.shtml">Estimating feature relevance<br />(2013)</a></dt>
			<dd>In this project, we propose a method for determining what musical attributes someone was paying attention to when they produced an annotation of a piece of music. The concept is relatively straightforward, and we get some interesting results using a simple quadratic programming algorithm.</dd>
			
			<dt><a href="http://www.music.mcgill.ca/~jordan/boundary-analysis/index.shtml">Boundaries and novelty<br />(2012)</a></dt>
			<dd>This <em>IEEE Transactions on Multimedia</em> article describes a test of how well acoustic novelty accounts for boundary indications in an annotated corpus.</dd>
			
			<dt><a href="http://www.music.mcgill.ca/~jordan/mimi-analysis/index.shtml">Listener disagreements<br />(2012)</a></dt>
			<dd>Co-authored by Isaac Schankler, this case study investigated how listeners manage to produce structural analyses that disagree with each other. The <a href="http://www.mtosmt.org/issues/mto.14.20.3/mto.14.20.3.smith_schankler_chew.html"><em>Music Theory Online</em> article</a> contains lots of audio files, videos and illustrations&mdash;definitely a welcome counterbalance to the dense text!</dd>
			
			
			<dt><a href="http://www.music.mcgill.ca/~jordan/structure/index.shtml">Master's thesis<br />(2010)</a></dt>
			<dd>For my Master's thesis, submitted in August 2010, I conducted a comparative evaluation of a handful of algorithms that produce formal analyses of music on a diverse set of corpora, including a new corpus of public domain music.</dd>
			
			<dt><a href="http://ddmal.music.mcgill.ca/salami/">SALAMI<br />(2010)</a></dt>
			<dd>The Structural Analysis of Large Amounts of Music Information (SALAMI) project is a multi-national effort to produce a corpus of analyses of hundreds of thousands of pieces of music. I oversaw the first phase of this project: the creation of a huge ground truth dataset. As part of my work, I developed and tested a novel annotation format, evaluated and hired annotators, oversaw months of data collection and presented the data at ISMIR 2011. I continue to manage and develop the dataset, which was <a href="http://ddmal.music.mcgill.ca/node/128">released to the public</a> in February 2012.</dd>

		<h4>IFT 6080 (<a href="http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~pift6080/H09/en/index.html">Class website</a>): Winter 2009</h4>
        <p>Final project:</p>
        <ul>
        	<li><em>Toward segmenting audio with multi-scale information.</em> The goal was to explore whether automatic segmentation of pieces of music could be improved by integrating information about the novelty of the piece at multiple time scales. No improvement over a baseline reported in other research was found, so a more clever approach to integrating the information needs to be found. Alternatively, it could be that the hierarchical structure I hoped to take advantage of can only be properly accessed or modelled once a more abstract version of the signal is obtained (i.e., after you have moved a few more steps beyond the low-level signal representation).</li>
        	<li>Presentation on automatic segmentation (<a href="http://www.music.mcgill.ca/~jordan/coursework/ift6080/auto-segmentation_presentation.zip">ZIP</a> of Keynote file)</li>

        <h4>MUMT 619 (<a href="http://www.music.mcgill.ca/~mwanderley/MUMT619/">Class website</a>): Winter 2009</h4>
        <p>Final project:</p>
        <ul>
        	<li><em>Digital Rainstick.</em> Mike Collicutt and I produced matching rainstick simulators: his was a physical controller that used silent beads and synthetic sounds; mine was a <a href="http://puredata.info/">Pd</a> patch that allowed a <a href="http://www.novint.com/index.php/novintfalcon">haptic controller</a> to interact with a <a href="http://www.idmil.org/software/dimple">DIMPLE</a> object, and used <a href="http://www.idmil.org/software/dimple">STK</a> (via <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChucK">ChucK</a>!) to turn collisions into synthetic sounds. (Whew!) Basically, it meant you could move one end of a virtual rainstick around in space and hear the results. You can watch our very informal oral presentation on YouTube (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enRTWjIDN7I">part 1</a> and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Icq7kip6Tg">part 2</a>) and <a href="http://www.music.mcgill.ca/~jordan/coursework/mumt619/rainstick.zip">download the patch</a>.</li>

			<dd>I led Game Control for DASH 5 and 6 in London. These were the first international editions of the <a href="http://www.playdash.org">Different Area, Same Hunt</a> series of puzzle hunts. These were my first experiences leading game control for a hunt (i.e., scouting locations, recruiting and managing volunteers, producing puzzle kits, etc.).</dd>

			<dd>In autumn 2013 I maintained a blog to which I posted mini-puzzles biweekly (not fortnightly). In an effort to stretch myself, I wrote two sets of clues for each grid.</dd>

			<dd>In June 2012 I made a one-round puzzle hunt for my family to enjoy at the cottage we used to frequent. I spent the equivalent of one work week of my vacation to put it all together, including all the related errands I found myself doing (printing, buying a jigsaw puzzle, groceries, etc.) in the days before the hunt. The hunt was inspired, both in length and in style, by the <a href="http://www.playdash.org">DASH puzzle events</a> that I had played for the previous 2 years. This is a slightly revised version of the hunt with solutions.</dd>
			<dt><a href="http://web.mit.edu/puzzle/www/2012/">MIT Mystery Hunt</a> (2012)</dt>
			<dd>As part of team CODEX, I had the honour of helping to write some puzzles for the <a href="http://web.mit.edu/puzzle/www/2012/">2012 MIT Mystery Hunt</a>. I contributed <a href="http://web.mit.edu/puzzle/www/2012/puzzles/memos_from_the_management/credits/author_6.html">3 puzzles</a> (and had a helping hand in putting together 3 more). The puzzle I'm most proud of is <a href="http://www.mit.edu/~puzzle/2012/puzzles/okla_holmes_a/yo_dawg_i_herd_you_like_puzzle_hunts/">Yo Dawg, I Herd You Like Puzzle Hunts</a>&mdash;don't peek at the answer without trying it first!</dd>
			<dt><a href="http://www.hcs.harvard.edu/hunt/2006/hunt/index.html">Harvard Puzzle Hunt</a> (2006)</dt>
			<dd>This event was my introduction to puzzle hunts. I helped write the meta puzzle with Emily Morgan and Andrew Lin (who went on to lead the production of CODEX's Mystery Hunt) and contributed a <a href="http://www.hcs.harvard.edu/hunt/2006/hunt/ingr_9/index.html">couple</a> <a href="http://www.hcs.harvard.edu/hunt/2006/hunt/table_talk/index.html">puzzles</a> too.</dd>
			<dt>The Harvard Independent (2006)</dt>
			<dd>At Harvard, while suffering from senioritis, I also occasionally contributed a puzzle feature to the <a href="http://www.harvardindependent.com/">Harvard Independent</a>. The Indy's online archive does not reach 2006, so you can't find these online. But that's for the best; they included some pretty awful puns and plenty of crosswordese.</dd>
