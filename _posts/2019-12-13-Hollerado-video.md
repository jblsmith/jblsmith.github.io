title: Hollerado music video
---

In [a post this summer](../Street-view-movie-maker/), I described [Google Street View Movie Maker](https://github.com/jblsmith/street-view-movie-maker), a script I wrote to download images from Street View to make short videos of routes. I mentioned that it was inspired by an idea for a music video based for "Don't Shake" by Hollerado. Well, I finally got around to making it! Here it is:

(I can't embed the video because it contains copyrighted music.)

I finished the video and posted it on December 13th, which was the date of Hollerado's last-ever show. The idea for the video is plainly sentimental: it traces the route from The Barfly in Montreal, one of the first venues they played, to The Danforth Music Hall in Toronto, where their three-day sold-out goodbye shows were played. The band toured extensively and must have logged tens of thousands of miles on the road. This video revisits about 330 of them.
