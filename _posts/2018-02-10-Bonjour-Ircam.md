title: Bonjour, Ircam!
---

As of February 1st, I have started a new position at [Ircam](https://www.ircam.fr/) and [CentraleSupélec](http://www.centralesupelec.fr/). I am a post-doctoral researcher on a project called “[Dig That Lick](http://dig-that-lick.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/)”, which will analyze melodic patterns in jazz music on a large scale.

It happens to be the second [Digging Into Data](https://diggingintodata.org/)-funded project I’ve worked on: during my Master's, I worked on the [SALAMI project](http://ddmal.music.mcgill.ca/research/salami), which was [funded by the same scheme](https://diggingintodata.org/awards/2009/project/structural-analysis-large-amounts-music-information).

The aim of Dig That Lick is to extract melodies from millions of jazz songs---especially the solo sections---and then to discover what "licks" or snippets of melody are reused most commonly. Then, using the metadata for all the songs---i.e., who played which solos, and who did they previously learn from or jam with---we hope to better understand how the jazz licks are invented and spread.

It all seems like a perfect analogy to genetics and genealogy (i.e., a genealonalogy): melodies, like DNA, can be thought of as strings of symbols, where each lick is a short substring, like a gene. Our goal is to determine which of these licks are important, and how they reproduced and were spread between musicians and styles.

I will be working one day a week at Ircam, which is housed in the Pompidou Centre:

But most days I will be at CentraleSupélec, a grande école south of Paris that is part of the newly-agglomerated Université de Paris-Saclay. The campus has some new, truly gorgeous buildings, but is still a bit under construction:
