title: Searching your YouTube history
---

You've just remembered a great video you saw on YouTube several weeks ago, and want to share it with your friend. But what was the video again?

You head to [YouTube History](https://www.youtube.com/feed/history), but it was a while ago and even though you can scroll forever, you're not sure you'd spot it.

So instead you click on [Search History](https://www.youtube.com/feed/history/search_history) to search your history. But alas, it's just a history of your searches.

But there is a way! Head to Google's [MyActivity](https://myactivity.google.com/) page, select [YouTube]([MyActivity](https://myactivity.google.com/myactivity?restrict=ytw)) from the list of items, and search away.

Why doesn't YouTube let you search your history? It would be dead-simple to implement: they already show you a list of things you've seen---just let you search it! The roundaboutness required here reminds me of another age-old UI conundrum: trying to look up Facebook friends by city. I.e., suppose you're planning a trip to San Francisco and you want to see who among your friends live there. Not who has "been there" or who "has lived there"---but who has their "Current city" set to San Francisco. It's such a common search need, and it's a search of non-private information that is available to you by other means (one-by-one lookup), but it's a feature that is missing, seemingly by design.

But there is actually a way around it: set your *own* current city to the city you want to search in; then, visit the "current city" tab in your own friends list. Of course, this muddies Facebook's own database of where you have lived; and you may want to delete the "X set their current city as Y" event from your feed.
