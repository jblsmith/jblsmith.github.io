title: Mathemusical Conversations book is published
---

I'm proud to announce the publication of [*Mathemusical Conversations: Mathematics and Computation in Music Performance and Composition*](http://www.worldscientific.com/worldscibooks/10.1142/10046), a book I edited with Professors Elaine Chew and GÃ©rard Assayag. Music and mathematics have deep historical connections that affect both fields today, and each chapter discusses some aspect of this relationship.

*Mathemusical Conversations* collects the writings of those who participated at the workshop of the same name, which was held in Singapore in Februrary 2015 and organized by Prof. Chew, Prof. Assayag, and Prof. Bernard Lanskey.
