title: Harper's cryptic
---

A few years ago, my boyfriend proposed to me in the pages of *Harper's Magazine*---his words embedded in the cryptic crossword! As an homage to my husband's proposal, as a thank you to that puzzle's author (Richard E. Maltby, Jr.), and as a gift to our wedding guests, I wrote a variety cryptic in the style of *Harper's*. I emailed a copy to Mr. Maltby Jr., and a week later got the thrill of my life: an invitation to print the puzzle in the pages of Harper's Magazine!

The puzzle---shown at right---ran in the [October 2022 issue](https://harpers.org/archive/2022/10/gentlemens-agreement/). It differs from my original draft: Maltby greatly improved many of the clues, which were written with greater devotion to the theme (love and weddings) than to elegance. Some of these improvements fairness.  sometimes just with a cleverer with a cleverer scrapping some altogether edited (and greatly improved!) many of the original clues, since the version that went out to guests had several references to family members, and some much more ham-fisted clues This version different from the wedding favour that the guests received

The puzzle I wrote for our guests was themed around love and weddings

The version that ran in *Harper's* is different from the original; at least half the clues were edited, and several of the weaker ones were scrapped and rewritten altogether by Maltby.
