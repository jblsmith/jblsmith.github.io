title: Farewell, AIST
---

Today was my final day at AIST. I am moving to Paris to start a new post-doc at IRCAM! It's been a wonderful three years here in Goto's lab, and I am really grateful to everyone in the lab who helped make my time here so enjoyable.

I'm happy also with the projects I managed to completed! At a farewell presentation on Tuesday, I gave the lab a brief overview of them:

- [The CrossSong Puzzle](https://staff.aist.go.jp/jun.kato/CrossSong/)
- [YouTube Video Classification]({{ site.baseurl }}/projects/music-video-classification/)
- [Multi-Part Pattern Description]({{ site.baseurl }}/projects/multi-part-pattern-analysis/)
- Another project, hopefully to be presented at ICASSP next April

Afterwards, we hurried along to 千年の宴 ("Thousand Year Feast"), which happens to be the same izakaya where my welcome party was held back in November 2014. Goto-san and the team offered me some lovely going-away gifts, a really touching card, and for dessert, a very delicious (and apt, given that I'm moving to Paris) éclair:

<div class="project_img"><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/blog-aist_farewell_cake.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/blog-aist_farewell_cake.jpg" alt="Farewell Eclair" style="width: 600px; border-radius: 15px;"/></a></div>

Right back at you---thank you, AIST!

I'm going to miss the group terribly, and hope to see many of them next year at ISMIR in Paris.
