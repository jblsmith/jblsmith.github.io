title: Modeling time signature changes at HAMR
---

[HAMR (Hacking Audio and Music Research)](https://labrosa.ee.columbia.edu/hamr/) is a hackathon event that has been held many times since 2013, and as a satellite event to every ISMIR conference since 2014. I attended [this year's event](https://labrosa.ee.columbia.edu/hamr_ismir2018/) held at [Deezer](https://www.deezer.com/en/) and really enjoyed it! To team up with others and try to solve a new research problem ASAP was exhilerating---it was almost like trying to solve a puzzle hunt.

I proposed a project to discover and model time signature changes and strange hypermeters---like in "Hey Ya!" by Outkast, where instead of getting 4 bars at a time (the most common hypermeter in popular music), we get 5&frac12; bars at a time. That situation is actually a combination of strange hypermeter and a time signature change; we ultimately focused on just the second aspect, trying to visualize and detect time signature changes.

I worked with [Olivier Lartillot](https://github.com/olivierlar) (who designed the famous [MIRtoolbox](https://www.jyu.fi/hytk/fi/laitokset/mutku/en/research/materials/mirtoolbox)) and [Romain Hennequin](https://github.com/romi1502), a researcher at Deezer. The progress we made on the problem felt very exciting, and others at the event shared our enthusiasm, awarding us the "Best Research Direction" prize!
