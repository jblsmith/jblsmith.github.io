Another holiday season spent at home, partly with COVID, has meant taking another stab at my Kurodoko hobby project. This time I've made a simple web interface to interact with puzzles and solve them! You can try it out here: [kurodoko.glitch.me](https://kurodoko.glitch.me/).

Here's a fiendish one I'm rather proud of:

I'm a long time admirer, first time user of [glitch](https://glitch.com/)! It took me a while to find a project that would be an appropriate starting point, and then to strip it down to exactly what I needed, but it's very satisfying to have a  website that *just works* which I can edit live.
