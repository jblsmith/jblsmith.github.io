title: CrossSong, in print and online
---

Our article about the CrossSong puzzle is now print! The article was published in the *Journal of New Music Research* (JNMR) with Open Access, so everyone can view [the full article online](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09298215.2017.1303519). I'm also pleased to announce a major update to the [online demo of our system](https://staff.aist.go.jp/jun.kato/CrossSong/demo/).

New features include:

1. Different puzzle sizes, so that users can get familiar with the basics before diving into the large puzzles. I strongly recommend trying the [2x2 puzzle](https://staff.aist.go.jp/jun.kato/CrossSong/demo/puzzle.html?num_squares=2&dirname=puzz1-rwc_short&difficulty_level=0) and [3x3 puzzle](https://staff.aist.go.jp/jun.kato/CrossSong/demo/puzzle.html?num_squares=3&dirname=puzz4-rwc_rock_vs_dance&difficulty_level=0)---you'll have a lot more fun solving the 4x4 puzzles afterward!

2. New puzzle layouts and new music! I'm fond of the [first "Rock vs. Dance" puzzle](https://staff.aist.go.jp/jun.kato/CrossSong/demo/puzzle.html?num_squares=4&dirname=puzz3-rwc_rock_vs_dance&difficulty_level=4). (Note that, for copyright reasons, all the puzzle content is from the [RWC database](https://staff.aist.go.jp/m.goto/RWC-MDB/).)

We hope you enjoy the game, and would love to hear your feedback---whether it's a question, complaint, or feature request!
