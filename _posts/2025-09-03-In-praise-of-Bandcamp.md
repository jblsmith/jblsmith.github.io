title: In praise of Bandcamp
---

Do you ever spend money on music? If so, I recommend that you use **[Bandcamp](https://bandcamp.com/)** to buy music directly from artists. On their app, when you buy music (songs, albums, physical copies, merch), the artist gets 85% of the money you spend. If you buy on "Bandcamp Friday", the first Friday of the month, Bandcamp forgoes their cut, sending 100% of revenue to the artist. The next [Bandcamp Friday](https://isitbandcampfriday.com/) is September 5th, 2025.

This is not a sponsored post! I have no vested interest in Bandcamp; my interest stems from my belief that artists should earn as much as possible from their music, and that intermediate parties — whether a streamer like Deezer, a record label like Warner, or a brick and mortar shop like HMV — should earn enough to keep the lights on, and not much more. In this post, I offer a few justifications for shopping at Bandcamp.


### Rates vs. cuts

When comparing music services, many people focus on the tiny payout-per-stream **rates**. For example, [in one accounting](https://soundcharts.com/blog/music-streaming-rates-payouts), Spotify was estimated to pay around $0.003 USD per stream, about a third of a penny; Apple Music pays a more generous one penny ($0.01) per stream; YouTube pays least of all, less than a tenth of a penny per stream.

But comparing these rates is not easy. Each service has a different formula for calculating payouts, which could depend on the size of one's audience, and whether one's listeners are paying subscribers or using an ad-supported tier. The fairness of one's payout also depends on how well the service can detect which listeners are authentic and which are bots — yes, [money laundering via Spotify streaming payouts is a thing](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/sep/05/swedish-criminal-gangs-using-fake-spotify-streams-to-launder-money).

The better way to compare services, I think, is to focus on the portion of revenue they keep. These services are all middlemen; the product is identical on each service; so, what's the middleman's **cut**? This is where the difference between services is starkest:

- For Spotify, [the revenue split is 30-70](https://dittomusic.com/en/blog/how-much-does-spotify-pay-per-stream). That is, of all the revenue Spotify earns from subscribers and advertisers, they keep around 30%, and pay out around 70%, to be split among the rightsholders.[^1]
- For Apple Music, [the revenue split is 48–52](https://artists.apple.com/support/1124-apple-music-insights-royalty-rate); Apple keeps almost half the profits!
- For YouTube, [the revenue split is 45–55](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/72902?hl=en-GB#zippy=%2Cwhats-my-revenue-share) for regular videos, and 55–45 for Shorts.
- For brick-and-mortar shops selling CDs and records, the typical [revenue split is (was?) 17–83](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-23840744), according to a BBC piece from 2013. (Was.)
- For Bandcamp, [the revenue split is 15–85](https://bandcamp.com/fair_trade_music_policy)! The split is even more favourable to artists for sales of physical media (10–90), or for sales on Bandcamp Friday (0–100).

Put another way: for every £1 earned by Apple Music, an artist earns £1.08. For every £1 earned by Spotify, an artist earns £2.30. For every £1 earned by Bandcamp, an artist earns at least £5.60 — and possibly much more. Bandcamp is clearly the most frugal middleman.

### Extra extra

There are other reasons to use Bandcamp. I like how I can get physical copies along with my digital purchases. I like how my purchases are permanent: I don't need to subscribe to a 'premium' version of the app in order to access my old purchases, and I can download the raw audio to any device I use. I like how when I play an album, and the album ends, there is silence, and I am allowed a moment of peace to consider what to play next.

I like how the money I spend goes directly to the artist I'm buying from, instead of being added to a [giant pool that is allotted pro-rata to all artists on the platform](https://www.sounds.co/en/post/royalties-streaming-pro-rata-model) — including people who are spamming Spotify by uploading AI-generated tracks. (Whether these uploads are part of another [royalties scam](https://www.wipo.int/web/wipo-magazine/articles/how-ai-generated-songs-are-fueling-the-rise-of-streaming-farms-74310, who cares) or part of a [scam yet to be understood](https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/14/24294995/spotify-ai-fake-albums-scam-distributors-metadata), I don't care; I don't want them to earn any of my money.)

And I like how the money I spend on the platform isn't funnelled into the pockets of tech billionaires who then reinvest that money into, for example, startups engaged in [developing AI tech for war](https://djmag.com/news/spotifys-daniel-ek-leads-eu600-million-investment-ai-military-defence-company). And even if the current or future owners of Bandcamp *did* want to invest in despicable things, they would not have much of my money to do so.

Finally, I like how streaming from Bandcamp is always free, with no ads. I didn't include Bandcamp's payout-per-stream rate earlier, but it is the lowest of all the services I've mentioned: zero. An artist earns nothing if you browse the library and try out their album. However, you cannot stream indefinitely; after listening to the album 3 times, you are prompted to buy the album instead. It reminds me of a time before streaming, when you would go to a music store and check out the new releases at a "listening booth". This seems like the right way for a music store to treat listeners, and the right way for listeners to treat artists.
